Slime Idle Game - MVP Design DocumentVersion: 1.0 MVP Date: November 11, 2025 Status: Ready for Beta TestingExecutive SummaryThis MVP focuses on delivering a core, playable loop with simplified systems. Players control a slime that auto-bounces through rooms, defeating defenders to gain Monster Energy, which is used to upgrade 6 Tier 1 nodes that enhance the slime's capabilities. The goal is to progress through 40 rooms with a reset system that provides permanent multipliers.Key MVP Simplifications:Only Tier 1 nodes (6 total)Physical damage and defense onlyNo status effects, elemental damage, or size mechanicsNo heroes, treasure, or fixtures40 rooms maximumActive play only (no offline progression for MVP)Core Gameplay LoopSlime auto-bounces through rooms, colliding with defendersDefeats defenders using physical damageGains Monster Energy from defeated entitiesUpgrades Tier 1 nodes using Monster EnergyProgresses through rooms (getting progressively harder)Resets around room 10 (or when stuck) for permanent multipliersRepeats with stronger permanent bonusesTier 1 Nodes (6 Total)1.
